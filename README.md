This program calculates the number of stars and habitable zone earth-sized planets as a function of distance (from the Sun) and of the host spectral type, considering the volume (number) density of stars in the solar neighborhood (based on the RECONS sample within 10 pc), host star parameters, approximate Kepler-based HZE occurrence rates, HZ boundaries from Kopparapu et al. 2013, and geometric transit probabilities. 
A figure showing the yield as a function of distance is generate for different target samples.

In a second step, the absolute flux density drop in I-band (corresponding to white lightcurve of Earth-transit) is calculated as a function of distance and of host spectral type. This allows the user the compare the precision required to detect the transits.
